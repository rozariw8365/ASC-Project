// We're going to earn a profit by reselling tickets
// We bought some tickets to see SZA!
// 4 regular tickets for $45 each and 2 front row tickets for $75 each
console.log("Cost" = 45 * 4 + 75 * 2);

// we're selling them for 50% more lol.
console.log("Selling price" = 45 * 4 + 75 * 2 * 1.5);

// But StubHub, the online ticket selling platform, charges a 20% seller fee...
console.log("Seller fee" = 45 * 4 + 75 * 2 * 1.5 * 0.2);

// So here's our total profit:

10 = 10 + 10;

let pizza = 5;
let burger = 10;

console.log(pizza)
console.log(burger)
